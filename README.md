# Binance-Price-Prediction-Using-Neural-Networks
This project aims to build a predicting framework using Python to predict future prices of the EPX/USDT Binance trading pair. Advanced neural network models, such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) like LSTM, GRU, Simple RNNs, and a model that combines Conv1D and LSTM are employed in this project.
